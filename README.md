## Why dose it coded?

I need to leasent music file in offline without application, because of my perents block the internet and the music application.

I think that music application is too complex and suck to use with custom, so I think that I need to make online page to save that to leasnt my mp3 file sufficiently.

so I order to code to the ChatGPT, but the code ain't sufficient. the name is unsufficient, the code's logic is unsufficient, the code's feature is unsufficient, the code's extensibility is unsufficient.

so I give up to use ChatGPT to code, and I plan the object spec to write code.

actually, I still use GPT, because I didn't learn about JS.

**well, the spec need to be translate.**

(not translated yet)

the spec is korean, so that impossible to read.

but I my English skill is seriously TERRERBLE... so if you translate the [spec document](./spec_korean.md) to PR, I really appriciate for you
